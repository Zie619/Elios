# Deep Q-Network (DQN) Project

This repository contains the work completed during the **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** course as part of my university curriculum. The project implements a DQN agent that solves reinforcement learning tasks using Q-learning with deep neural networks.

## Project Overview

The DQN algorithm is a type of **reinforcement learning** where the agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Key elements of the project include:

- **Q-Learning**: The agent approximates the optimal action-value function using a neural network.
- **Replay Buffer**: Experience replay is used to store past experiences for more efficient learning.
- **Target Network**: A target network is employed to stabilize training.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff**: Epsilon-greedy strategy is used to balance exploration of the environment and exploitation of learned actions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For building and training the deep Q-network.
- **OpenAI Gym**: For testing the DQN agent in various environments.
- **NumPy & Matplotlib**: For numerical computation and result visualization.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dqn-course-project.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_dqn.py
   ```

## Results

The trained DQN agent was able to successfully solve the environment, achieving optimal rewards after several episodes of training. The results and training progress are visualized using Matplotlib.
